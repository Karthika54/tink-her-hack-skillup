# [Skill-Up] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [She_code]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Mrudhula Mohan] - [NSS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING]
- Member 2: [Karthika C] - [NSS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://tink-her-hack-skillup.vercel.app/]

### Project Description
[SkillLink is a smart, student-friendly platform where people can exchange skills instead of money. It connects learners locally, helps schedule sessions, and gamifies learning with SkillCoins and community leaderboards.]

### The Problem statement
[Many people have valuable skills — coding, design, cooking, photography, writing — but:
They can’t afford professional courses.
They struggle to find someone nearby who can teach or learn in return.
There’s no trusted platform for fair, local skill exchange.
So, SkillLink bridges this gap by connecting people who want to learn a skill with those who can teach it.]

### The Solution
[A community-driven app that allows users to:
Offer their own skills (“I can teach Python”)
Search for others’ skills (“Looking to learn guitar”)
Exchange time/skills instead of money — a “teach one, learn one” model.]
